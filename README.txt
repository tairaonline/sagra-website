This is the website of SAGRA

The South African Gospel Recognition Awards (SAGRA), established in
2021, is a proudly faith-driven initiative committed to honoring and
uplifting those who dedicate their voices and talents to spreading the
Gospel through music. Founded on the principle of speaking for those
whose contributions often go unrecognized, SAGRA shines a spotlight on
gospel artists working tirelessly behind the microphone, inspiring
hope, healing, and transformation through their art. We are more than
just an awards platform; we are a movement that seeks to develop,
mentor, and empower the next generation of gospel musicians across
South Africa. Through strategic recognition and community engagement,
we aim to build a sustainable legacy that supports both established
and emerging talents in their spiritual and musical journeys.
